DISCRIPTION OF FUNCTIONS
Functions should have comments directly following their declaraion. A utility
called describeFunctions.sh looks inside files in the ~/bin/functs directory 
for anything string with a '(' after it. IE: function() would match.
After it finds a function, it then looks for lines beginning with '#' to
display. As soon as it gets the a line without a '#' it assumes the description
has finished.
 Help: to get a list of all functions, run "listFunctions.sh"
       to describe a particular function, run "describeFunction.sh functionName"
       to list and describe all functions, run "describeAllFunctions.sh"
